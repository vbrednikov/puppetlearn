Customized Mastering Puppet Devops Way
======================================

This is a set of scripts to support docker-based environment  for learning 
[Mastering Puppet the devops way by School of Devops](https://www.udemy.com/mastering-puppet-the-devops-way/) course 
on udemy.com

In original version, a puppet environment consisting of puppet master and 4 nodes is started. Puppet master also launches 
[Akurath](https://github.com/codespaces-io/akurath) tool that eats some resources and is not very useful for me.

In addition, nodes should be joined to the puppet.
